Emotion detection is an important process in our project
which requires accuracy and this can be done effectively
with the help of facial expressions which is how humans
understand and interpret an emotion. Research shows that
when a personâ€™s facial expressions are read, it can actually
vary your interpretation of what is being spoken and it can
also control how the conversation turns out. Humans are
capable of perceiving emotions which is exceedingly
important for a communication to be a success and hence in
a typical conversation almost 93% of communication
depends on the emotion being expressed.
